# Website

This is the repository for my [website](www.kallerouvinen.com), built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While my main web expertise lies in **React**, I opted for simplicity in this project to keep the structure clean and lightweight.

## Technologies
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, using Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness
- **JavaScript**: For form handling

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kallerouvinen/website.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd website
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

No additional dependencies or build steps are required since this project is purely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
